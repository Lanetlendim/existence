\begin{document}
    \maketitle
    \begin{definition}[Field]
        P is either true or false, no exceptions. \\
        True: T, 1, true \\ 
        False: F, 0, false
        
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}[Implication/Condition]
    $P \implies Q$  , it isn't needed to be meaningful in the natural language, "if 5 is even, then 6 is even" is a logically true sentence, $0 \implies 1 \equiv 1$
  
    Only case where $P \implies Q \equiv 0$ is where $P \equiv 1$ and $Q \equiv 0$
    the formula $0 \implies 1 \equiv 1$ justifies beginning of set theory with empty set $\emptyset$. %TODO: write set theory and ZFC in order to link here.
    \end{definition}
    \begin{definition}[Biconditional]
      $P \iff{Q}$ is true only if both P and Q is false or both P and Q is true. Again, there is no need for a natural language grounding for it to be true,
     "turkish coffee is great if and only if napoleon is alive." which means turkish coffee is not great, though i do not consent.
    \end{definition}
    
    \begin{definition}[Negation]
      $\neg P$ not p 
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Conjunction]
   $P \wedge Q$ P or Q, $P \equiv 0$ and $Q \equiv 0$ implies $P \wedge Q \equiv 0$ 
      "I am racist and istanbul is fucking sucks" is true, although it is not generally the case that "and" is a connection that requires relevance      
    \end{definition}


    \begin{definition}[Disjunction]
      $P \lor Q$
      
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Exclusive Disjunction]
      $(P \oplus Q) = \neg(P \wedge Q) \wedge $ %TODO: this is false fix it

    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[True False]
      $\top$ or $1$ or $T$ defined as true, 
      $\bot$ or $0$ or $F$ defined as false
      
    \end{definition}
