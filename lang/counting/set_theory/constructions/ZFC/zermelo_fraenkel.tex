    Existentionality: $\mathbb{A}={a_1,a_2,...} \land \mathbb{B}={a_1,a_2,...} \implies $ theres no reason to use B, they're equal. 
    %TODO: if they are equal that means content of a set is its identity, There must not be an empty set, study identity and non-existence
    \\
    Pairing: if $\mathbb{A}$ and $\mathbb{B}$ is at set then theres a set with its content being $\{\A, \B\}$
\\
    Union: set of sets $\mathbb{S}={\A, \B, \C}$ is equal to $\bigcup \mathbb{S}=\A\cup\B\cup\C\cup...$
    \\ 
    Power set: $\forall \mathbb{S} \mid \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{S})$ is equal to every subset of S
