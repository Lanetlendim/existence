\begin{document}
    \maketitle
    The real number line, real line, coordinate line, all same. It's 1 dimentional entity that is used as a graph. \\ 
  $\forall x (x \in \mathbb{R} \implies \text{x has a place in real line})$ \\ \\ 
  $  \mathcal{O}$ is defined as origin. Like every other $(x \geq 1)D$ \\ 
  $ \mathcal{O} \mapsto 0 $ in real line. \\ 
  Every point on a line is referred as $P$ \\ 
  Example:   $\sqrt{2}$ is somewhere between $1.41$ and $1.42$ 
  \\ 
  \\ 
  Real numbers are ordered. the order is represented as $(\mathbb{R}, Less_{\mathbb{R}})$ \footnote{\href{url:///home/uhh/_Documents/existence/Existence/lang/logic/first_order_logic/}{Check out first order logic}} \\ %% TODO: Finish first order logic writing
  let  $\mathbb{A} \subset \mathbb{R}$ \\ 
  we can't write $\mathbb{A}= \{..\}$ because there's infinite amount of numbers between $a_1$ and $a_2$ \\ 
instead we write $\mathbb{A} = (a_1,a_2)$  do you see the pattern? It's like $(\mathbb{R}, Less_{\mathbb{R}})$ \\ 
and like real number line, $\mathbb{A}$ represents a line, which is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ \\ 
Another way to write this is; \\ 
$\mathbb{A} = \{x | a < x < b \}$ \footnote{\href{}{first order logic}}
