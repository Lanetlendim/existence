    And: $\wedge$ \\ 
    Or: $\vee$ \\ 
    Implies: $\implies$ \\ 
    (Finn $\wedge$ jake) kills the monster $\implies$ town has been saved. \\
    you see that "kills" is a relation, we can assign a symbol to it but it wouldn't fit our use case in math, as we don't generally kill someone. \\ \\ 

    Exists: $\exists$ \\ 
    All: $\forall$ \\ 
    $\exists x (x:= \text{Finn} \vee x:= \text{Jake})$  \footnote{\href{url:///home/uhh/_Documents/existence/Existence/lang/logic/basics/formulas/existentially_quantified_formula/definition.pdf}{What does this shape mean? It's like f(x)!!}} \\ 
    If everything in the existence were finn or jake, we could write; \\ 
    $\forall x (x:= \text{finn} \vee x:= \text{jake})$ \\ 
    But god damn it, we are not! So let's write that\dots \\ 
    Not: $\neg$ \\
    $\forall x (\neg (x:= \text{finn} \vee x:= \text{jake}))$
