\begin{document}
    \maketitle
    Reality itself isn't fully covered by human modelling and it never will.\footnote{\href{https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/khomskii/recursion/Goedel.pdf}{Kurt Godel's incompleteness theorem}} Although we can feel good about what we accomplished and how much it is close to reality itself. \footnote{Limit} %% TODO: finish writing limit 

    Keep in mind: We are not explaining reality itself, we are explaining our understanding of reality.
